- In the new project, this README file should contain the following information:
	- The name and email of the lead developer.
	- Instructions about how to set up a development environment. This is everything a developer would need to know after cloning the project. For example: node commands, frameworks used and version numbers, Unity version number, etc.
	- Instructions about how to make builds.
	- Instructions for deployment to development, staging, and production servers, or to app stores. 
- Alternately, this README file should tell where to find this information.

# Setting up dev
This project uses Vue3 and TypeScript! Download the repo, and use npm install to grab all the necessary packages.
`npm run dev` <- dev environment
`npm run build` <- build for prod. If you're building within a folder, make sure the BASE path matches in the npm script

# Branches
We have a translation branch, which is used for the MASI version of the game. It has slightly different features, content, and language. Should not be merged.
